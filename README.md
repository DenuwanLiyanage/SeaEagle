We have come up with a method to connect Navy ships, boats and control base using wireless communication methods. We have proposed to use Wifi to make the connection and GPS to track the respective ships and boats.  

Navy ships are continuously checking whether boats in the sea are suspicious or not when they are offshore. This is done manually by the crew of the navy ships by entering the suspicious boats. There they get headcount of the boat and ask about the projected path of the boat. There is an issue of being prone to damage for the navy ship when the navy ship is coming closer to the other boats as it is much larger than the other boats. Our project idea is to create a system where navy ship will be able to obtain the details of the boat when it is within a certain range of distance from the boats.
